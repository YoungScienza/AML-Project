# Projects:
## Automated Machine Learning: Meta-Learning for XGBoost hyperparameters
This project focuses on developing a meta-learning approach to optimize hyperparameters for the XGBoost algorithm. 
By leveraging a large dataset of XGBoost configurations evaluated across numerous classification tasks, the goal is to predict the best configurations for new classification problems. 
The project includes experimenting with various performance predictors, evaluating useful meta-features, and identifying the most influential hyperparameters to enhance the default configuration.
