# Projects:
## Automated Machine Learning: Meta-Learning for XGBoost hyperparameters
This project focuses on developing a meta-learning approach to optimize hyperparameters for the XGBoost algorithm. 
By leveraging a large dataset of XGBoost configurations evaluated across numerous classification tasks, the goal is to predict the best configurations for new classification problems. 
The project includes experimenting with various performance predictors, evaluating useful meta-features, and identifying the most influential hyperparameters to enhance the default configuration.

## Bachelor_Thesis: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) forecasting through the use of Recency Frequency and Monetary (RFM) variables.
This projects aims at forecasting the CLV using RFM variables and other simple variables obtained from Customer Relationship Management (CRM) data. The models used range from the linear model to the Rando Forest. In particular, I used a simple linear model as a baseline and then tried to modify the target variable (log-lin and quantile transformation) to get more stable results. I also tried to use RandomForest errors to try to detect unseen patterns in them. For the RandomForest model, I also tried to modify the target variable (log transformation). Finally, I tested different data transformations to see how the models behave. The comments are in Italian.
